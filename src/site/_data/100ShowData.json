The shape of this bottle has an architectural quality, taking cues from iconic columns and intricate trim of the cathedral. The label features a horse brand icon in honor of one of Moore’s earliest brands. The brand’s many flourishes and motifs were heavily inspired by vintage advertisements and stationery from the Thomas S. Moore archives.",

Working to shatter and rebuild visitors expectations of the story, Solid Light employed angular forms, custom structures, juxtaposed materials and artifacts, colorized historic photography, and bold projection-mapped immersive media. This new museum experience presents a landscape of war-time choices, real human connection, and a narrative aimed at resetting the conversation.",

The Monogram Experience Center is a physical location where designers, dealers and salespeople are invited to learn about the brand and interact with products. As such, all materials supporting the MEC must meet the exacting standards set forth by the brand. The Power Agency redesigned all marketing materials, including a comprehensive folder and supporting documents, with careful attention to detail - including paper selections, varnishes and user experience - in mind.",
